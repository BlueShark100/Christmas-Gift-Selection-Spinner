# Christmas-Gift-Selection-Spinner
Time to hand out presents! Who's gift should we hand out next?

## How it works
Using the "Settings" button at the bottom of the page you can enter the people you want on the wheel and the amount of present each of them have. Then, just click the wheel to spin it!

Each time you spin the wheel the site will calculated a normalised probability for each person to be selected. If someone has 10 presents and another person has 5, the person with 10 will be twice as likely to be chosen. This way we can even out the handouts as we go

Once a person has been chosen on the next spin, their original chances have been reduced by 65%! This way, we aren't repeating the same person over and over. But there's still a chance! The person chosen two wheel spins ago has their chances reduced by only 30% so avoid too much ping pong from two people with lots of gifts.

## Notice for Mobile
I'm working on making it better for mobile use. The settings menu is a little pinched and its possible that you can't delete people because of it. There will be a fix soon.
