# Christmas-Gift-Selection-Spinner
Time to hand out presents! Who's gift should we hand out next?

## How it works
Using the "Settings" button at the bottom of the page you can enter the people you want on the wheel and the amount of presents each of them have. Then, just click the wheel to spin it! Once someone has been selected, click again to dismiss the message and go back to the wheel to spin again.

The likelyhood of someone being selected depends on the amount of presents they have yet to open. If someone has 10 presents and another person has 5, the person with 10 will be twice as likely to be chosen. This way we can even out the handouts as we go.

Once a person has been chosen, on the next spin, their original chances are reduced by 65%! This way we aren't repeating the same person over and over. But there's still a chance! The person chosen two wheel spins ago has their chances reduced by only 30% to avoid too much ping pong from two people with lots of gifts.

## Notice for Mobile
I'm working on making it better for mobile use. The settings menu is a little pinched and its possible that you can't delete people because of it.
